        <h1>Teaching Strategies & Techniques</h1>
        <p>A willingness to bring new teaching strategies into your lesson plan is one of the best 
        qualities a teacher can have.
        <br>
        In Effective Teaching and Learning, educational researcher Naga Subramani argues that an effective teacher:
        <br>
        “Constantly renews himself [or herself] as a professional on his [or her] quest to provide students 
        with the highest quality of education possible. This teacherhas no fear of learning new teaching 
        strategies or incorporating new technologies into lessons.”</p>

                <h2>1. Classroom management strategies</h2>
                <p>According to research from 2006, teachers overwhelmingly reported a lack of professional 
                development support when it came to improving their own classroom management strategies. 
                This can lead to confusion for students and frustration for teachers.
                <br>
                When students clearly understand what’s expected of them, they’re more likely to be focused 
                and engaged with their lessons. Some tips for building a positive environment include:</p>

                <h2>2. Flexible seating</h2>
                <p>a teacher in the Bucyrus Elementary Preschool Program, connects student seating and academics: 
                “When students aren’t trying to hold themselves still in their chairs, they can integrate auditory, 
                visual and tactile systems of the body.”
                <br>
                There are so many different ways to incorporate flexible seating into your classroom in a way 
                that fits with your students’ learning goals. For examples and best practices, read Flexible

                <h2>3. Active learning</h2>
                <p>Put students at the center of the classroom with active learning strategies — a teaching 
                technique that increases student engagement in daily lessons. According to active learning 
                advocate James Ballencia, the technique can also help teachers as much as it helps students:
                <br>
                “With the goal of teaching mindful learners who actively pursue knowledge, teachers become 
                more actively engaged in how they teach the curriculum and how they develop each student’s 
                learning potential. They mix and match a variety of … tactics to ensure that students not 
                only learn more, better, and faster -- they also learn smarter.”</p>

                <h3>4. Personalized learning</h3>
                <p>No two students are exactly alike. That’s why personalized learning builds a learning 
                experience that addresses the unique abilities of each student.
                    <br>
                According to a study by the Gates Foundation, personalized learning can improve test scores 
                    <br>
                “Students attending [schools using personalized learning] made gains in math and reading over 
                the last two years that are significantly greater than a virtual control group made up of similar 
                students selected from comparable schools.”</p>

                <h2>5. Multiplication games</h2>
                <p>Multiplication is a difficult concept for many students to grasp. Memorizing and understanding  
                core multiplication facts is a key element of math fluency, and provides an essential foundation 
                for further study.
                    <br>
                Game-based learning can be a successful way to help students develop this understanding and 
                can engage students on stressful topic.</p>
