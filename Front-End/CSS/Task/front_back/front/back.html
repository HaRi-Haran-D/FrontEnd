            <h1>FrontEnd vs BackEnd: Which One Should I Choose?</h1>
            <p>Developing a website is a wonderful task that now every individual wishes to do. 
            There are more than 1 billion websites running today and more than 200 million of 
            them are active. Web Development has become one of the most demanding and highest-paying 
            jobs in India or outside India. The integral part of web development is Frontend and 
            Backend. As Web Development is acing up the technology, both the frontend and backend 
            developers collectively work on it. Hence, it's always been confusion as to which profession 
            to choose between the two (FrontEnd or BackEnd).</p>

            <h2 id="frodev">What is FrontEnd Development?</h2>
            <p><b>Frontend development is the creation of a website that you interact with directly (client-side).</b> 
            It is the development of everything on a website that you experience including icons, buttons, 
            fonts, layout, color, etc. With a click of a button, you see the magic happening which is 
            submitting a form, playing a video, navigating to a new page, etc.
        <br /><br />
            <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to structure and add styles, color, layouts, and functioning 
            to the website respectively.</b> Frontend developers also use various other tools and technologies 
            to build a completely functional website.</p>

            <h2 id="bckdev">What is BackEnd Development?</h2>
            <p><b>Backend development is the development of the client-side (server-side) of the application.</b> 
            This process involves knowledge of APIs, databases, servers, and apps. APIs play a major role 
            in backend development, it takes care of fetching the data from the backend and passing it 
            to the frontend.
            <br /><br />The actual operation in backend development is that it allows a database to 
            communicate with the application, thus transferring the data to the frontend from 
            the backend. In contrast to front-end development where customers can have a look 
            at the UI, back-end development works on compiling code for the integration of a 
            database with an application.</p>

            <p>A backend developer is a professional who works on creating the server side of 
            the web application. Backend developers build and maintain the application to 
            process data and perform operations on the website. They are responsible for 
            data processing, storage, and retrieval.
        <br /><br />They must be skilled with fundamentals like programming languages 
        (JavaScript, Python, Java), databases, APIs, servers, data structures and algorithms, 
        testing, and debugging. They take care of the server side of the application working 
        efficiently, securely, and reliably. Not only just technical skills, a backend developer 
        should be strong in problem-solving skills to handle complex scenarios, time management, 
        and other required non-technical skills.</p>

                <li><b>Database Management Systems (DBMS)</b>
                <br />DBMS acts as a crucial part of backend development as it stores, 
                processes, and retrieves data. Backend developers use databases that 
                act as an interface between the user and the database to create, 
                read, update, store, and process data.

                    CSS, and JavaScript. You need to have a good command of these languages. Having a degree or 
                    not doesn't matter these days if you truly have the will and skills to become a front-end 
                    developer. Also, the front end requires less coding, unlike the back end for which you need 
                    to have complete knowledge of the front end and back end. Even if you have got less interest 
                    in DSA, it's completely fine with the front end. For being a front-end developer, knowledge 
                    of the three fundamental languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and some frameworks is enough 
                    and you get hands-on practice after implementing a few web pages. It's not easy to learn but 
                    also not too difficult.</li>

            <h3 class="satis">4. Job Satisfaction</h3>
                <p>Choosing front-end or back-end development as a profession depends on multiple factors such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What skills do you have?</li>
                    <li>are you interested in coding?</li>
                    <li>are you good at problem-solving skills?</li>
                    <li>how good you're at designing the page?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your answer satisfies the questions, you're all ready to choose the career. Suppose, 
                you're someone who's good at designing the page, wants less coding, and is not too good 
                at DSA, then in that case you may look for front-end development.
                <br /><br />
                And, if you're someone who's good at DSA, and has problem-solving skills, you may then 
                opt for back-end development. A back-end developer gets a huge amount of salary as compared 
                to a front-end developer.</p>

            <h2 id="concl">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Choosing any domain depends on your interest and skill, so before choosing front-end or 
            back-end development as your career, make sure you have the required skills. Also, apart from 
            this, the salary of a front-end developer differs from that of a back-end developer. Both 
            (front-end and back-end) are the best profession any developer can have and both are the 
            highest-paying ones. Therefore, you should definitely consider these factors before jumping 
            to any conclusion.</p>
