                <h3>MT15 V2</h3>
                <p>The Yamaha MT 15 V2 Standard in Racing Blue is a dynamic streetfighter 
                that blends aggressive styling with impressive performance. Powered by a 
                155 cc liquid-cooled, single-cylinder engine, it delivers 18.4 PS of power 
                and 14.1 Nm of torque, paired with a smooth 6-speed manual transmission. 
                With a top speed of 130 kmph and a mileage of 56.87 kmpl, it offers both 
                thrill and efficiency. The bike features a telescopic upside-down front fork 
                and a linked-type Monocross rear suspension, ensuring a stable and responsive 
                ride.  Weighing just 141 kg with a ground clearance of 170 mm, it’s agile and 
                city-friendly. Safety is enhanced with dual-channel ABS and disc brakes on both 
                ends, while modern touches like LED lighting, a digital instrument console, 
                alloy wheels, and tubeless tyres add to its appeal. For buyers seeking 
                flexible payment options, Bajaj Finserv offers two-wheeler loans through 
                Bajaj Mall, making ownership more accessible. Would you like this tailored for
