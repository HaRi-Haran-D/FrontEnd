                <p>Wolverine's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, 
                    typically referred to as his mutant healing factor, that regenerates 
                    damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond that of normal 
                    humans. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, 
                    Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to 
                    diseases, drugs and toxins.</p>
