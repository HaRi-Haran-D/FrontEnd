                        <p> Meanwhile, in a quaint little village, Monkey D. Luffy is born. He’s accidentally 
                            eaten a devil fruit, mystical fruits that grant magical abilities at the cost of 
                            your ability to swim. Luffy’s fruit, the Gum Gum fruit, allows him to stretch like 
                            rubber. His idol is the pirate Red-Haired Shanks, who saves his life from a sea 
                            serpent, sacrificing his arm for his friend. Before Shanks leaves, he gifts Luffy 
                            his Straw Hat, which becomes Luffy’s most prized possession.Luffy is so inspired 
                            by Shanks he decides once he is old enough, he will set sail and find the One Piece 
                            and become the new King of the Pirates.</p>

                        reported to openly welcome pirates and treat them like celebrities. On the island, 
                        the Straw Hats party hard under a false sense of security. It isn’t until the main 
                        crew is asleep that it’s revealed that all the residents of Whiskey Peak are secretly 
                        assassins and bounty hunters. In fact, the town turns out to be a part of the same 
                        group that Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday are from, the two bounty hunters who were introduced 
                        in the Reverse Mountain arc. However, Zoro is aware of the town’s true intentions, 
                        faking his drunken stupor and sobering up to fight almost every bounty hunter in Whiskey 
                        Peak. Luffy’s misunderstanding that Zoro was hurting the residents of Whiskey Peak for 
                        no apparent reason. It’s a hilarious fight before they eventually both understand and 
                        team up against the Whiskey Peak residents. The most important development is the 
                        revelation that Miss Wednesday is, in fact, Princess Nefertari Vivi, who went undercover 
                        in the organization that we now know is called Baroque Works. </p>

                    <h3>Little Garden Arc</h3>
                    <p>On their mission to bring Princess Vivi, who was undercover in Baroque Works as 
                        Ms. Wednesday, to Arabasta, the crew land at Little Garden, which is actually a huge 
                        island that is still stuck in the prehistoric era. However, there are more than 
                        dinosaurs on this island, as the crew soon finds out when they encounter two giants 
                        that have been locked in combat for over 100 years. However, their friendly interactions 
                        are cut short when Baroque Works interrupts their duel, earning the ire of Dorry, 
                        Broggy, and the entire Straw Hat crew. The Little Garden story arc also established 
                        new stakes for the Straw Hat Pirates crew, with Nami catching a dreadful illness that no 
                        one could cure. So, the Straw Hats had to venture to Drum Island and seek a doctor.</p>

                    <h3>Drum Island Arc</h3>
                    <p> To cure Nami the Straw Hats need to make a little detour to the kingless land, 
                        Drum Island. Before getting there, they have a little run-in with the pirate Wapol, 
                        who is the wielder of the Baku Baku no Mi Devil Fruit, allowing him to eat anything 
                        they please and manifest it within his body. Luffy deals with him with no problem, 
                        and he and his crew head onward. To get to Dr. Kureha, Sanji and Luffy must carry Nami 
                        on a treacherous path up the highest mountain to Drum Castle. After being attacked on 
                        the way, Luffy winds up carrying Sanji and Nami, injuring himself in the process. 
                        Luckily, they manage to make it to the castle just as Luffy collapses. Meanwhile, 
                        Wapol returns to his former kingdom and overpowers the militia before heading to his 
                        old home, Drum Castle. With Wapol defeated and Nami better, Luffy convinces Chopper to 
                        join his crew—after all, a medic would be very handy! Chopper agrees to go and the 
                        island gives them a great send-off allowing the Straw Hats to continue on their journey 
                        to deliver Princess Vivi to Alabasta.</p>

                    <h3>Albasta Arc</h3>
                    <p>When the Straw Hats reach the kingdom of Alabasta, we learn that Baroque Works is ruling 
                        it from the shadows. We learn that Crocodile, the leader of Baroque Works, is one of 
                        the Seven Warlords of the Sea, a group of extremely strong pirates that have actually 
                        made deals with the navy.Before the civil war starts Vivi must reach the rebels and 
                        tell them the real cause behind the conflict, but Crocodile the leader of Baroque Works 
                        and one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, will not just stand by and watch. In the end, 
                        Baroque Works, marine forces, pirates, the royal guards, and the rebel army clash in a 
                        battle that will determine the fate of the country itself.  Nami obtains her Clima-Tact; 
                        Roronoa Zoro receives his first wanted poster; Luffy saves Nico Robin's life and 
                        Crocodile's Warlord title is revoked.</p>
