                        <p>The Golden Age of Piracy has gone into full bloom due to the pirate Gol D. Roger
                            finding the One Piece, the greatest treasure known to man. Despite his execution
                            by the navy, his dying words instructing people the world over to find his greatest

                    <p>Meanwhile, in a quaint little village, Monkey D. Luffy is born. He’s accidentally 
                    eaten a devil fruit, mystical fruits that grant magical abilities at the cost of 
                    your ability to swim. Luffy’s fruit, the Gum Gum fruit, allows him to stretch like 
                    rubber. His idol is the pirate Red-Haired Shanks, who saves his life from a sea 
                    serpent, sacrificing his arm for his friend. Before Shanks leaves, he gifts Luffy 
                    his Straw Hat, which becomes Luffy’s most prized possession.Luffy is so inspired by 
                    Shanks he decides once he is old enough, he will set sail and find the One Piece and 
                    become the new King of the Pirates.</p>

                <p>After rescuing timid aspiring marine Koby from the pirate Alvida, Luffy moves on to finding 
                    the crew he needs to take on the world. His first crewmate is the swordsman Roronoa Zoro who 
                    uses the 3-sword style. He recruits Zoro after they take down a corrupt marine base and Koby 
                    joins the marines after inspiration and words of encouragement from Luffy.</p>
