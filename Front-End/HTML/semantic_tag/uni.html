                    <h3>Episode 1:The Cruelty</h3>
                    <p>Tanjiro Kamado lives a quiet, peaceful life with his family in the snowy 
                    mountains of Japan, providing for them by selling charcoal at the nearby 
                    town. After returning home from town, Tanjiro finds his family brutally 
                    murdered by a demon, with only his sister Nezuko surviving—though she’s been 
                    turned into a demon herself. Despite her transformation, Nezuko shows signs 
                    of retaining her humanity, which catches the attention of Giyu Tomioka.</p>

                    <p>Following Giyu’s guidance, Tanjiro travels with Nezuko to Mount Sagiri to 
                        meet Sakonji Urokodaki, a former member of the Demon Slayer Corps. Along 
                        the way, he faces a demon and uses his wits and determination to defeat it—his 
                        first taste of the dangers ahead. Urokodaki tests Tanjiro’s resolve by making 
                        him survive a perilous descent through the mountain filled with traps. When 
                        Tanjiro passes the test, Urokodaki agrees to train him in the art of becoming 
                        a Demon Slayer.</p>

                    <h3>Episode 3:Sabito and Makomo</h3>
                    <p>Tanjiro undergoes harsh training under Urokodaki, learning sword techniques and 
                        mastering Total Concentration Breathing. As the months pass, his physical 
                        abilities grow—but his final challenge is to split a massive boulder. Struggling 
                        to do so, Tanjiro meets two mysterious children named Sabito and Makomo, former 
                        students of Urokodaki. They push him beyond his limits, especially Sabito, who 
                        mercilessly trains him in combat. Through their guidance, Tanjiro eventually 
                        achieves the impossible—he cleaves the boulder in two, earning the right to take 
                        part in the Final Selection.</p>

                    <p>Tanjiro arrives at a remote forest where the Demon Slayer Corps holds the Final 
                        Selection—an intense survival test where participants must last seven days among 
                        bloodthirsty demons. Amidst the fight for survival, Tanjiro encounters the powerful 
                        and grotesque Hand Demon, infamous for killing many of Urokodaki’s previous pupils. 
                        Driven by sorrow and vengeance, Tanjiro uses his Water Breathing techniques to defeat 
                        the demon in a fierce battle. He survives the ordeal and is officially accepted into 
                        the Demon Slayer Corps, ready to face a dark and dangerous world ahead.</p>

                    <p>Tanjiro passes the Final Selection and chooses the ore for his special sword. He returns 
                        to Urokodaki’s home, where Nezuko finally wakes up after a long rest. Tanjiro receives 
                        his black Nichirin blade and learns that some demons have unique Blood Demon Arts. His 
                        crow delivers his first mission: investigate mysterious disappearances of young girls 
                        in a nearby town.</p>

                    <p>Tanjiro sets out on his first mission as a Demon Slayer, traveling to a town where young 
                        girls have mysteriously vanished. He meets Kazumi, whose fiancée was one of the 
                        victims, and begins investigating using his keen sense of smell. At night, Tanjiro detects 
                        a demon and rescues a girl from its swamp-like portal. He discovers the demon can split 
                        into three clones and move through underground puddles. As the battle intensifies, Nezuko 
                        bursts from her box and joins the fight, protecting the humans. Tanjiro realizes these 
                        demons may hold clues about Muzan Kibutsuji—the original demon who turned Nezuko—and 
                        prepares to confront them.</p>

                    <h3>Episode 7:Muzan Kibutsuji</h3>
                    <p>Tanjiro dives into the demon’s swamp dimension to finish off the remaining clones, 
                        using his Water Breathing Sixth Form: Whirlpool to defeat them underwater. Meanwhile, 
                        Nezuko battles the last clone on the surface, showing surprising strength. After 
                        Tanjiro returns and finishes the fight, he questions the demon about Muzan 
                        Kibutsuji—but the demon is too terrified to speak his name and is swiftly killed. 
                        Tanjiro comforts Kazumi, the grieving fiancé, and prepares to move on. His crow 
                        delivers a new mission: head to Asakusa, Tokyo. Upon arriving, Tanjiro is overwhelmed 
                        by the bustling city—but then catches a familiar scent. He tracks it and comes 
                        face-to-face with Muzan himself, disguised as a human with a wife and child. Muzan, 
                        sensing danger, turns a passerby into a demon to distract Tanjiro and escape.</p>
